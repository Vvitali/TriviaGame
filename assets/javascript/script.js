}

//I have to create an object which will store questions, and answers
//and also I have to create a function (constructor), which will take questions, and put it in the object(As I did with The Matrix RPG game).

//For displaying content - I will use mainArea div, and jquery .html method.
//To take the answer - I will create button-listener, and get data-correct atribute - if it 1 - show the answer, and go futher.
